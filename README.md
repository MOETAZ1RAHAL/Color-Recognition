# Color-Recognition
This project demonstrates basic color detection using OpenCV in Python. It allows you to detect a specific color in an image or video by adjusting the Hue, Saturation, and Value (HSV) ranges with interactive trackbars. The program highlights the detected color using a mask and shows the resulting image in real time.
